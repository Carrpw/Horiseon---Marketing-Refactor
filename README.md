  ## Description

  I started this project by downloading the mock webpages inital code from gitlab and creating a temporty space for it on my computer. Switching over to gibhub, I created a new repository and placed all of the initial code I would be starting from in it. Using the new repository to git pull from, I placed all the code into the appropriate homework folder on my computer to work locally from. 
  Upon opening the files to refactor the code, I noticed several sections in the html file that were done incorrectly and needed to be fixed in order for the page to be rendered correctly. The link for "search engin optimization" and every single jpg & png had to be fixed so that they would properly load. When these elements were fixed and the webpage looked fairly close to what it was supposed to, I saved the changes to my local copy and then pushed it to github where it was saved.
  Once the webpage was loading as intended, I started to work on the html semantics so that the code would have tags and comments that made different sections obvious to the reader and provided more information so that you could understand the importance of the sections. I then added further detail by adding accessible alt atributes to each of the png & jpg sections. In addition, I added a title section that gave a concise view of what the webpage would be about so that the customers looking at the website would easily be able to remember what the internet tab was if they had a bunch open or couldn't remember what they had opened previously. After completing the title I saved the changes locally again before pushing my work to github again.
  Looking over the html, everthing seemed to be in order so I switched tracks and started working on the css file. The first thing I did was rearrange each of the style tags in the css so that they followed the flow of the html. So the style tags would be grouped for instance by the header semantic followed by the nav semantic for the first section since thats how it looked in the html file. I then added comments above each of the sections in css so that it would be easier to understand why they were in groupings and removed anything superfluous in the file. Finally I pushed the changes I had made locally to github to be saved. 
  I looked over my files one last time after a break so that I could look at it with fresh eyes and made any minute changes I thought necessary or changes to some of the code that I may have overlooked before. Once satisfied I pushed my changes again to github.
  Finally I made this readme added pushed one last time to github before sending in the links.
